The solution is clean, maintainable, and easily extendable following best practices  for console applications pattern.

overall summary of changes made to the original code:


Highghted improvements include:
1. **Dependency Injection**: The use of interfaces and constructor injection allows for greater flexibility and testability of the code.
2. **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and exceptions gracefully.
2. **Extensibility**: The design allows for easy addition of new features or modifications to existing ones without significant changes to the overall structure.

Exta features were added to enhance the functionality of the application, such as:
Asynchronous Patterns: Now all services  follow async patterns tasync Task to support potential future async operations.
Logging: A simple logging mechanism was added to track application events and errors.
Config-Driven Greetings: Supports future extensibility without code changes.

User Experience**: 
The console interface is user-friendly, providing clear instructions and feedback to the user. e.g lets assume the time is 12:00 the application with generate greeting based on time of the day by picking system time and greet user accordingly.
If a language is not supported, English is used as fallback or as default language.
